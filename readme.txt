Version 1.3:
1. Time Slot did not considered.
2. We have:
	a. First-Fit
		(a) Fixed Flex: "FixedFlex" & "FiFM"
		(b) Fully Flex: "FullyFlex" & "FFM"
		(c) Isolated Core: "IsolatedCore" & "ICM"
	b. Bandwidth-Fit="FuFVF" & "FuFVFM"
		both of the 2 are Fully Flex
	c. Largest-Fit="FuFBF" & "FuFBFM"
		both of the 2 are Fully Flex
3. Continuity constrait applied.
4. If an algorithm ends with 'M', it means it is number-of-seg-variable
5. Unicast applied.
